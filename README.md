# Bash Scripts
This repo collects some of the bash scripts i've put together for common tasks, SO answers or personal projects.
# 1. Rate Limit Linux Processes

- Script to rate limit any command. 
- Usage:

```bash
./rate_limit.sh <rate at which to throttle: [mk]bps> <interface name> <command>
```


# 2. Scripts to manage browser bookmarks

- Use bm (shell cli tool) to manage bookmarks
- Sync existing bookmarks and browsing history from UI-based browsers into bm
- Scripts to search and launch URLs from bm


# 3. Mkfifo

Based on the answer I provided to this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51633182/linux-named-pipes-mkfifo-query/51674928#51674928
